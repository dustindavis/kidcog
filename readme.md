# What is this?  #

[Todo]

## Task list ##

**Architecture**


- Break out "games" and "animations" into physical modules
- Break out rendering into an actual render component
- Setup animation states to return deferred so actions can be chained when animations complete

**General**


- Performance

**Animations**

- Potentially switch to HTML5 canvas?
- Fix the CSS bugs
  - Each enemy stops further and further away from player. If I change the class to position: absolute instead of relative, it works but the whole line of enemies is visible

**Game**

- Needs an end point

**Styling**


- Game board needs to be better organized. Smaller question square and answer squares in a 2x2 grid on the right
- System needs to be broken up into screens (start/level select, actual game, final results)
